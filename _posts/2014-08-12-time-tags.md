Next to stability the single most relevant concern we have when it comes to
running our builds on Travis CI is performance. We want to push our changes and
see the build result as quickly as possible.

So far Travis CI has lacked dedicated tools for optimizing your builds. You got
to know the wall-clock execution time of your build jobs, but it was hard to
figure out how long each command took, unless you'd prepend every single one of
your commands with `time`.

Starting today Travis CI measures and displays the runtime of relevant
commands, such as cloning your repository, installing dependencies, running
before and after scripts, and running your tests.

These per-command time tags, as we chose to call them, provide extra information
for you to optimize your build. And here's how they currently look:

![Travis CI Per Command Time Tags](http://s3itch.svenfuchs.com/travis-ci-time-tags-20140811-130937.jpg)

We'll continue to polish the visual design of these tags, and future
improvements to our build script compilation will make adding time tags to
certain commands more consistent across various languages.

Enjoy!

_The [original implementation](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build/pull/199)
of these time tags was provided by
[Łukasz Sarnacki](https://github.com/lukesarnacki) and the current
implementation is heavily based on his great work._

__Thank you, Łukasz!__

_With his brother [Piotr](https://github.com/drogus) being one of our long term
[core team](https://travis-ci.com/team) members, this means ALL OF THE
SARNACKIs (brothers) are now Travis CI contributors._
