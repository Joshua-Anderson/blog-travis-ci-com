## Announcing Beta testing for Android Build support

As the world becomes more and more mobile, our users' demand for
support for developing for the mobile devices only increases.

We have had iOS support [just over a year](http://blog.travis-ci.com/introducing-mac-ios-rubymotion-testing/).

Today, we are pleased to announce the beta testing for Android builds on
Travis CI, bringing our market coverage to [over 90%](https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2014/3/comScore_Reports_January_2014_US_Smartphone_Subscriber_Market_Share).

Without further ado, head on over to the [Android development guide](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/android/)
and get started!

## Huge thanks to Gilles Cornu

Gilles Cornu was instrumental in bringing the first-class Android support
to Travis CI.

Thank you, Gilles! You are awesome.
