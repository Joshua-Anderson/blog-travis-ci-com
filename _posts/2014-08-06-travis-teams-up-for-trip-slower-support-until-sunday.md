###Travis Teams up for Trip - Slower Support until Sunday

From tomorrow (Thursday, 7th) until Sunday our team is going on a trip
together, for the first time ever!

We flew in everyone from New Zealand, the US, Norway - and Potsdam - to meet in
Berlin. We've visited [eurucamp](http://2014.eurucamp.org/) which was an
absolute blast (and we promise to blog about it more soon).

Now Sven, Justine, Mathias, Piotr, Kontantin, Hiro, Josh, Henrik, Fritz
and I (plus two Aeropress and one Chemex) are boarding a bus that takes us into
the green, a nice remote place in the middle of nowhere in northern Germany.

We'll spend some time away from our laptops and some non-remote
hours with each other.

Yes, you heard right - away from our laptops. We'll still take them
with us and respond all your [support
mails](mailto:support@travis-ci.org) in batches, but this will be slower
than you are used to from us. We'll be paddling, barbequeing, cooking and
picking some flowers in between so please forgive a somewhat slower support
coverage until Sunday.

See you back on full speed support on Monday!
