###Travis Teams up for Trip - Slower Support until Sunday

From tomorrow (Thursday, 7th) until Sunday our team is going on a trip for the first time ever! 

We flew in everyone from New Zealand, the US, Norway - and Potsdam - to meet in Berlin. Now Sven, Justine, Mathias, Piotr, Kontantin, Hiro, Josh, Henrik, Fritz and I (plus two Aeropress and one Chemex) are boarding a bus that takes us into the green. We’ll spend some time away from our laptops and some non-remote hours with each other. 

Yes, you heard right - away from our laptops. Which means we’ll still take them with us and try to answer all your [support mails](mailto:support@travis-ci.org) in the evening, but this will be slower than you are used to from us. We’ll have to go paddling, barbeque some food and pick some flowers in between so please forgive a somewhat slower support coverage until Sunday.

See you back on full support speed on Monday!
